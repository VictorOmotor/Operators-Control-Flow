- Assignment Operators: 20 * 4 = 80; Let a = 4; a += 5 //a = 9
- Comparison Operators: '2' == 2 //True; 30 < 12 //False
- Logical Operators: 22 < 34 && 30 !== 29 //True; true = 0 || 34 === 'John' //False
- Bitwise Operators: (~45) = -45; 100==32 & 20==34 //False

4. The result will iterate the following numbers: 1, 8, 15.
